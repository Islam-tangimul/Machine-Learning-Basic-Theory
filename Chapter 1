# Chapter One: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Types of Learning  

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves creating computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence—such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In biomedical science, AI enables machines to assist with diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, and personalizing treatment plans.

Examples in biomedicine:
- AI-powered diagnostic tools interpreting X-rays or MRIs.
- Virtual health assistants providing patient support.
- Predicting disease outbreaks using large datasets.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. 
In biomedical science, ML algorithms analyze complex biological data—like genomics or patient records—to discover patterns and improve healthcare outcomes.

Examples in biomedicine:
- Predicting patient risk for diseases such as diabetes or cancer.
- Analyzing gene expression data to classify cancer subtypes.
- Drug discovery by predicting molecule interactions.

## Relationship between AI and ML
- AI is the broader goal of making machines “intelligent.”
- ML provides practical tools to achieve AI by learning from biomedical data and improving over time.

## Types of Machine Learning & Biomedical Applications

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled biomedical data where the outcome is known.
- Examples:  
  - Predicting disease presence from patient symptoms and test results.  
  - Classifying medical images into normal vs. pathological.

- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees.
- Use case: Predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign based on imaging and biopsy data.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled biomedical data.
- Examples:  
  - Grouping patients based on gene expression profiles to discover disease subtypes.  
  - Detecting anomalies in heart rate data that could indicate arrhythmias.
- Common algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Use case: Segmenting patient populations to tailor treatments.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns optimal actions based on feedback from the environment.
- Examples:  
  - Optimizing radiation therapy dosing schedules to maximize treatment effect while minimizing side effects.  
  - Training robotic surgical assistants.
- Use case: Personalized treatment planning where the system learns the best therapy path.

## Why is Machine Learning Important in Biomedical Science?
- Handles massive and complex biomedical datasets.
- Helps discover biomarkers for diseases.
- Enables personalized medicine by tailoring treatments to individual patient data.
- Improves diagnostic accuracy and speed.
- Automates tedious tasks like image analysis.
