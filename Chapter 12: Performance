## Why Measure Performance?
Evaluating how well a model predicts or classifies biomedical data is crucial to ensure reliability and usefulness in clinical settings.

## Key Performance Metrics

### 1. Accuracy
- The proportion of correct predictions (both positive and negative) out of total cases.

### 2. Precision
- How many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive.

### 3. Recall (Sensitivity)
- How many actual positive cases the model correctly identifies.

### 4. Specificity
- How many actual negative cases the model correctly identifies.

### 5. F1 Score
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced data.

### 6. ROC Curve and AUC
- Receiver Operating Characteristic curve plots true positive rate vs false positive rate.
- Area Under Curve (AUC) measures overall ability to discriminate between classes.

## Biomedical Examples
- Diagnosing diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes) where missing positive cases (false negatives) can be critical.
- Screening tests where high sensitivity is prioritized.
- Predicting patient outcomes where balance between precision and recall matters.

## Cross-Validation
- Technique to assess model performance by partitioning data into training and testing sets multiple times to avoid overfitting.

## Confusion Matrix

                   Predicted Positive  Predicted Negative 
 Actual Positive   True Positive (TP)   False Negative (FN) 
 Actual Negative   False Positive (FP)  True Negative (TN)  

## Summary
 Accuracy    Overall correctness but can be misleading with imbalanced data 
 Precision   Trustworthiness of positive predictions                     
 Recall      Ability to detect all positive cases (e.g., disease cases)  
 Specificity Correctly identifying negatives (e.g., healthy patients)    
 F1 Score    Balance between precision and recall                         
 AUC         Overall model discrimination power
