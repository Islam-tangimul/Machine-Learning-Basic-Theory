## What is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a collection of interconnected neurons (nodes) organized in layers. Unlike a single perceptron, a neural network can model complex, nonlinear relationships in data.

### Basic Structure:
- **Input Layer:** Receives features (e.g., patient measurements)
- **Hidden Layers:** Perform transformations and extract patterns
- **Output Layer:** Produces predictions (e.g., disease classification)

## Why Use Neural Networks?
- Handle complex, nonlinear biomedical data (imaging, genomics, signals).
- Learn hierarchical feature representations.
- High predictive accuracy in many biomedical applications.

## Biomedical Applications of Neural Networks

### 1. Medical Image Analysis
Detecting tumors, segmenting organs, and diagnosing from scans.

### 2. Genomic Data Interpretation
Predicting gene functions, mutations, and disease risks.

### 3. Patient Outcome Prediction
Forecasting disease progression or treatment response.

## How Neural Networks Learn
- Weights are initialized randomly.
- Data is fed forward through layers.
- Errors are calculated at output.
- Backpropagation updates weights to minimize errors.

## Example: Predicting Cancer from Gene Expression
A neural network can learn complex patterns in gene expression profiles to classify cancer types.

## Advantages
- Can approximate any function given enough data and neurons.
- Flexible for various types of biomedical data.

## Limitations
- Require large amounts of data and computation.
- Harder to interpret than simpler models.
- Risk of overfitting if not properly regularized.
