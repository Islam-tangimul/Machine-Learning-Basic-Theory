## What is a Perceptron?
The perceptron is the simplest type of artificial neural network and a binary classifier. It models a single neuron that takes multiple input features, applies weights, sums them up, and passes the result through an activation function (usually a step function) to produce an output (0 or 1).

## Why Use Perceptrons?
- Forms the basis for more complex neural networks.
- Good for linearly separable problems.
- Simple and interpretable.

## Biomedical Applications of Perceptrons

### 1. Binary Disease Classification
Determining presence or absence of diseases based on patient features.

### 2. Signal Classification
Classifying biomedical signals like ECG as normal or abnormal.

### 3. Early Neural Network Models
Foundations for deep learning applications in medical imaging and genomics.

## How Perceptron Learning Works
1. Initialize weights randomly.
2. For each training sample, compute output.
3. Update weights if prediction is wrong.
4. Repeat until convergence or max iterations.

## Advantages
- Easy to implement and understand.
- Fast training for simple datasets.

## Limitations
- Only works for linearly separable data.
- Cannot solve complex problems like XOR.
- Limited representational power compared to modern neural networks.
