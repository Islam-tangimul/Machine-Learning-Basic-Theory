## What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?
PCA is an unsupervised learning technique used for **dimensionality reduction**. It transforms high-dimensional data into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called **principal components**, which capture the most variance in the data.

This helps simplify datasets while retaining essential information.

## Why Use PCA?
- Biomedical data (like gene expression or imaging) often have thousands of features.
- Reduces noise and redundancy.
- Makes visualization and analysis easier.
- Helps improve performance of other machine learning algorithms.

## Biomedical Applications of PCA

### 1. Gene Expression Analysis
Reducing thousands of gene expression measurements to a few principal components to find patterns related to diseases.

### 2. Medical Imaging
Compressing image data for faster processing and analysis.

### 3. Patient Stratification
Visualizing patient clusters in reduced dimensions.

## How PCA Works
1. Standardize the data.
2. Compute the covariance matrix to understand feature relationships.
3. Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix

## Example: Cancer Subtype Identification
Using PCA on gene expression data can reveal clusters representing different cancer subtypes, aiding diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Advantages
- Removes correlated features.
- Simplifies data visualization.
- Speeds up learning algorithms.

## Limitations
- Principal components may be hard to interpret biologically.
- Only captures linear relationships.
- Sensitive to scaling of features.
