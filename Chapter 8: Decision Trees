## What is a Decision Tree?
A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It splits data into branches based on feature values, leading to decisions or predictions in a tree-like structure.
Each internal node tests a feature, each branch corresponds to a feature value, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class or continuous value).

## Why Use Decision Trees?
- Highly interpretable and easy to visualize.
- Can handle both categorical and continuous features.
- Nonlinear relationships can be captured.
- Requires little data preprocessing.

## Biomedical Applications of Decision Trees

### 1. Disease Diagnosis
Classifying patients based on symptoms, lab results, and medical history.

### 2. Treatment Decision Support
Helping doctors decide treatment plans based on patient characteristics.

### 3. Risk Stratification
Identifying high-risk patients for closer monitoring or intervention.

## How Decision Trees Work
1. Select the best feature to split data based on criteria like **Gini impurity** or **information gain**.
2. Partition the dataset into subsets based on feature values.
3. Repeat the process recursively on each subset until the stopping criteria (e.g., max depth or minimum samples) are met.
4. Assign a class label or value to leaf nodes.

## Example: Diagnosing Diabetes
The tree might first split patients based on glucose levels, then age, then BMI, leading to leaf nodes indicating diabetic or non-diabetic status.

## Advantages
- Easy to interpret and explain.
- Handles missing values.
- Captures feature interactions.

## Limitations
- Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
- Small changes in data can produce different trees.
- Less accurate than ensemble methods on some tasks.
