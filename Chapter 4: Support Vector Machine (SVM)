### Powerful Classification for Biomedical Data

## What is a Support Vector Machine?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification (and regression).
It finds the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.

Key idea:  
- SVM tries to maximize the distance (margin) between the closest data points of each class (called support vectors) and the decision boundary.

## Why Use SVM?
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces (like gene expression data).
- Works well with a clear margin of separation.
- Can handle nonlinear boundaries using kernel functions.

## Biomedical Applications of SVM

### 1. Cancer Classification
- Classifying tumor samples as benign or malignant based on gene expression or imaging data.

### 2. Disease Diagnosis
- Distinguishing patients with or without a disease from clinical data.

### 3. Biomarker Identification
- Identifying important features that contribute to classification.

## Linear vs Nonlinear SVM
- **Linear SVM:** Finds a straight hyperplane to separate classes.
- **Nonlinear SVM:** Uses kernel functions (e.g., RBF, polynomial) to map data into higher dimensions where classes become separable.

## Example: Tumor Classification
Given gene expression profiles of tumors, SVM can classify them into malignant or benign groups by finding the optimal hyperplane separating these groups.

## Advantages
- Robust to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional spaces.
- Works well with small to medium datasets.

## Limitations
- Choosing the right kernel and parameters can be complex.
- Computationally intensive for very large datasets.

## Summary

Support Vectors       Critical data points closest to the decision boundary    
Hyperplane            Decision boundary separating classes                     
Kernel Function       Transforms data to a higher dimension for nonlinear cases
