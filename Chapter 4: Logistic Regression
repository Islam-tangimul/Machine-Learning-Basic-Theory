 ## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems — predicting discrete outcomes, typically binary (yes/no, disease/no disease).
Instead of predicting a continuous value like linear regression, logistic regression predicts the **probability** that a given input belongs to a particular class.

## Why Logistic Regression?
- Interpretable — coefficients show how features affect the log-odds of an outcome.
- Effective for binary classification tasks.
- Can be extended to multi-class problems (multinomial logistic regression).

## Biomedical Applications of Logistic Regression
### 1. Disease Diagnosis
Predicting whether a patient has a disease (e.g., diabetes, cancer) based on clinical measurements and test results.

### 2. Patient Risk Stratification
Estimating the risk of readmission or adverse events in hospitals.

### 3. Biomarker Analysis
Determining which biomarkers significantly increase the odds of developing a condition.

## Limitations

- Cannot model complex nonlinear relationships without feature engineering.
- Sensitive to outliers.
- Assumes a linear decision boundary.

## Summary

 Odds                The ratio of the event happening to not happening                 
 Log-odds (logit)    The natural logarithm of odds                                
 Sigmoid function    Maps predictions to probabilities between 0 and 1
