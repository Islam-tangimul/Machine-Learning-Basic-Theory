## What is K-Means Clustering?
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group unlabeled data into **k** clusters based on feature similarity. 
It partitions the data so that points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters.

## Why Use K-Means?
- Helps discover natural groupings in complex biomedical data.
- Simple and efficient for large datasets.
- Useful for exploratory data analysis.

## Biomedical Applications of K-Means

### 1. Patient Segmentation
Grouping patients based on clinical measurements or genetic profiles to identify disease subtypes or risk groups.

### 2. Gene Expression Analysis
Clustering genes with similar expression patterns to understand biological processes.

### 3. Medical Image Segmentation
Separating different tissue types or abnormal regions in imaging data.

## How K-Means Works
1. Select the number of clusters, **k**.
2. Initialize **k** cluster centroids randomly.
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
4. Recalculate centroids as the mean of points assigned to each cluster.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until cluster assignments stabilize.

## Example: Clustering Patients by Symptoms
Given patient symptom data, K-Means can group patients into clusters representing distinct disease subtypes or severity levels.

## Advantages
- Fast and scalable.
- Easy to implement and interpret.

## Limitations
- Requires choosing **k** in advance.
- Sensitive to initial centroid placement.
- Assumes spherical clusters of similar size.
